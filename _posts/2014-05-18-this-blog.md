The purpose of this blog is two fold:

1. Document thoughts, idea, and theories.
2. Get comfortable with web development tools, in particulary, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.




After searching for a simple system to blog, I resolved to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) along with [Github pages](https://pages.github.com). I found a simple theme called [Poole](http://getpoole.com) that I modified slightly.

I used the following tutorials to set up Github Pages & Jekyll:

1. [Github Pages + Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages)
2. [Analytics + Poole](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) 
3. [Tags](http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/)

Here is a picture I took from Heybalidad, Istanbul:
